# Scoping and Planning for Proposal 

## Initial Considerations 

The below items must also be considered at the stage of conception so that the feasibility of the project can be assessed and designed effectively – A great research questions sadly doesn’t always equate to a great project. 

### What/ How 

* What are the research objectives of the project? Do the research objectives make sense? For example have many similar projects taken place before, in which case is this piece of research necessary by examining a new or novel aspect? 

* What data will be used for this project? How will this data be collected, how will permission be obtained to use it, how will it be cleaned/ merged and formatted in preparation for the research? Will the data contain sensitive information? If so, how will the data be stored and accessed to ensure it remains secure?

* What methods of analysis is the project proposing, what subsequent research resources will be required to support this? 

* How will the results be used when the project has concluded to ensure that all the hard work doesn’t end up in the draw? 

### Who 

* Who will be involved in preparing, conducting & presenting findings. Are they in place already, if not how will they be recruited?

* Is your institution/ researchers the people for the job, are there existing groups that should be invited to collaborate or consulted before work begins? 

### Why 

* What will the impact be to the immediate stakeholders of the project? What is the impact to the research community as a result of this work being undertaken. What are the possible benefits and negatives to wider society of the work being undertaken? What are the ethical implications of the project and how can these be mitigated against.

## Idea to Proposal 

When an idea is first conceived, it is unlikely to arrive as a perfectly formed research question, it will likely enter a scoping phase which will tease out a sensible and feasible version of the question and sub questions.  

For example, if the key question is fairly general or wide reaching, it will need to be broken down into sub questions that can then be tackled empirically. 

The data proposed might then not be suitable to answer the adjusted question and so re-framing might be necessary so that the data remains expected to answer the question. 

## The Initial Proposal 

The project proposal (or a similar document) is one of the first items that will be produced. This will likely be used to pitch the project to collaborators and funders, and to generally spread the word of its conception to stakeholders and the research community.  

An initial review of the data should take place before the proposal is written, to identify obvious issues, if there are major issues these should be addressed, or at least mitigation plans defined, before the proposal is finalised. 

The initial proposal does not need to be perfect and should be considered a document for iteration. 

The proposal should map out key elements of the project as much as is possible at the time of writing. The exercise of writing the proposal will likely reveal gaps and that is ok!

The project proposal will likely be written by the scientific researchers involved in the project, with peer review encouraged. It's not expected that the full team will be in place by this stage and the proposal may well be used to attract talent to the project.  

Equally the project partner could have authorship and in the context of Data Study Groups, it is the organisation proposing the project that writes the project proposal. In such cases we advise that the proposal is subject to academic review.  

Concretely a data science project proposal should include: 

* A description the project and the challenge it seeks to solve. 

* Back ground information : Why is solving this challenge beneficial. What are the main difficulties, or approaches that have been considered/tried before (if applicable). How is the project necessary to the solution of the problem as well as the scientific basis for this.

* Data information : What data will be used for the project. It might be useful to include information on each dataset including data inventory, size, variable descriptions, description of data collection mechanism, level of data sensitivity/confidentiality, etc. How will this data need to be handled and are there any known issues of working with data of this kind, how will these be mitigated against. How will permission be obtained to use this data?

* Project impact: What is the expected impact of the project? Considering its direct stakeholders, wider society and research community. What would channels of follow up work look like after the project and what is the intended use of any findings.
